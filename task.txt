Hi Corey,

Wonderful - hope you're having fun in the US! The challenge is below. We typically give candidates a week to work on it, but if you need more time because of travels let me know :). I've also attached a doc with some info on Blockchain that you might find interesting!

Please write a web app that accepts GET requests on the
/address/:bitcoin_addr route, and responds with a JSON-formatted list
of all unspent transaction outputs for that address, specifying the
following for each such output:

value
transaction hash
output index
You might find our API useful to access that data (documentation at
https://blockchain.info/api/blockchain_api, in particular you'll want
to look at the address/ endpoints), but you are welcome to use any
block explorer or some other alternative source for this information
if you prefer.

Usage example of the app you should develop:

$ curl http://localhost:8080/address/1Aff4FgrtA1dZDwajmknWTwU2WtwUvfiXa
{
"outputs": [{
"value": 63871,
"txhash":
"db9b6ff6ba4fd5813fe1ae8980ee30645221e333c0f647bb1fc777d0f58d3e23",
"outputidx": 1
}]
}
